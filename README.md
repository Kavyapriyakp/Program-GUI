# Program-GUI
GUI of a software prototype with latest features developed to aid surveillance systems' monitoring.

##Project Title
<div align="justify">
Reuqirement of real-time compensation for turbulence and detecting moving objects 
</div>

##About
<div align="justify">
The objective of the project is to develop an algorithm for detecting and rectifying the  atmospheric turbulence, Spatio-temporal blur, hence improving the quality of input video  using the electro-optical systems and finding all moving objects including vehicles and  humans. The aim is to develop an approach that combines multi-frame image reconstruction  with Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based moving object detection and General  Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to de-blur input videos.
